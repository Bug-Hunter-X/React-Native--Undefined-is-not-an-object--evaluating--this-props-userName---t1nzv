This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or a prop before it has been assigned a value. This often happens when you try to render a component before its data has fully loaded, or when you try to access a prop before it has been passed down from a parent component.  For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.props.userName}</Text> 
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

If `this.props.userName` hasn't been defined yet, the app will crash.
